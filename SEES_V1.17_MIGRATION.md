# Sees Fork: v1.13.1-dev → v1.17.0-dev Migration Assessment

**Date:** 2026-09-03
**Branches:** `origin/v1.13.1_dev` (old baseline) → `origin/v1.17.0-dev` (new baseline)
**Scope:** (1) what upstream PX4 changed between these baselines, (2) what Sees changed on top of v1.13.1, (3) a per-commit recommendation for bringing our changes onto v1.17.0-dev.

---

## 1. Upstream PX4 changes, v1.13.1 → v1.17.0

`v1.13.1_dev` is `v1.13.1` + 41 Sees commits (`git describe` → `v1.13.1-0.0.41`). `v1.17.0-dev` is `v1.17.0` + a handful of newer commits (`git describe` → `v1.17.0-0.0.1-6-g6e2a8da15f`). This spans **4 upstream PX4 releases**:

| Tag | Release date |
|---|---|
| v1.13.1 | 2022-09-28 |
| v1.14.0 | 2023-08-10 |
| v1.15.0 | 2024-08-23 |
| v1.16.0 | 2025-08-05 |
| v1.17.0 | 2026-01-16 |

**Scale:** 7,718 commits, 12,265 files touched (6,745 excluding `docs/`), ~533k insertions / ~167k deletions in firmware code. Of the 7,622 non-merge commits in range, 7,589 are stock upstream PX4 commits (top authors: Pavel Kirienko, Daniel Agar, Silvan Fuhrer, Matthias Grob, bresch) — this is fundamentally a full upstream re-sync, not an incremental bump.

### Major architectural changes to be aware of

These are the changes most likely to affect where our custom commits land:

- **Fixed-wing control rewrite**: `fw_pos_control_l1` → replaced by `fw_lateral_longitudinal_control` + `fw_mode_manager` + `fw_rate_control`. (_DONT_CARE_)
- **Rover control rewrite**: `rover_pos_control` → replaced by `rover_ackermann` / `rover_differential` / `rover_mecanum`. (_DONT_CARE_)
- **Comms/middleware overhaul**: `microdds_client` / `micrortps_bridge` → replaced by `uxrce_dds_client`; new `zenoh` transport module. (_DONT_CARE_ for now unless we directly use zenoh instead of mavlink)
- **SITL restructuring**: `sih` / `simulator` → replaced by a new `simulation` module tree. (_DONT_CARE_)
- **Commander failsafe rewrite**: `state_machine_helper.cpp` → replaced by `commander/failsafe/{failsafe.cpp, framework.cpp}`.
- **Pre-arm checks rewrite**: `Arming/PreFlightCheck/PreFlightCheck.cpp` → replaced by `HealthAndArmingChecks/checks/*.cpp`.
- **Battery library rewrite**: voltage-lookup-table SoC estimation → RLS internal-resistance estimator (`interpolate(v_empty, v_charged)`).
- **Rate control library**: `mc_rate_control/RateControl` → moved to shared `src/lib/rate_control/`, used by MC/FW/rover/spacecraft, with a plain `update()` signature (no D-term/drag-compensation hooks).
- **Manual control**: message schema moved to `msg/versioned/ManualControlSetpoint.msg`; `ManualControlSelector` rewritten to an enum-based `RcInMode`. (_Will add our own SEES_* on top_)
- **UAVCAN GNSS channel assignment**: node-ID ordering hacks replaced by `get_channel_index_for_node()`. (Decide whether we want to backport their changes from latest master into v1.17. GPS issues still exist in v1.17. Some have been backported by William)
- **New driver/module categories**: `cyphal`, `gnss`, `ins`, `rc`, `gpio`, `transponder`, `wind_sensor`, `payload_deliverer`, `internal_combustion_engine_control`, `mc_nn_control`. (We benefit from newer GPS module support)
- **~50 new board targets** added (Auterion fmu-v6x/v6s, CUAV x25-evo, Holybro kakuteh7 family, ModalAI VOXL2, NXP mr-tropic, PX4 fmu-v6xrt, Espressif esp32, etc).
- Heavy churn throughout EKF2, MAVLink, Navigator, Commander, VTOL, TECS, NuttX platform code. (Could impact us - beware - do flight tests)

## 2. Sees custom changes on `v1.13.1_dev`

Identified by diffing `v1.13.1_dev` against upstream PX4 at their merge-base, then filtering to commits merged as fork-native PRs (`#26`–`#99`) into the Sees repo directly (as opposed to backports of upstream PX4 PRs, which were excluded).

**57 commits, PR #26 (2022-12-29) → PR #99 (2026-03-20).** Authors: mostly `DavidPaddy97` (David Patrick, 47 commits — matches the "Dp ..." commit-message prefix convention), plus `wsolichin@sees.ai`/`wsolichin-sees`, `ealdaz-seesai`/`sees-dev` (Eduardo Aldaz), `dpatrick@sees.ai`, `mrossi@sees.ai`/`m.rossi@live.com`, `github@richardhopkirk.net`, and one commit each from `abamforth`.

**Important:** cross-checked against `v1.17.0-dev`'s own non-upstream commits — **none of these 57 have been ported yet.** The only genuinely Sees-authored commits already on `v1.17.0-dev` are two unrelated newer items by `ealdaz@sees.ai` ("Reenabled standard option to allow QGC to send RP position" and "feat(remoteid): DroneCAN arm_status keepalive + rate and system message fixes"), confirmed not to overlap with any of the 57 below. The rest of `v1.17.0-dev`'s non-upstream-main commits are backports cherry-picked from PX4's own `release/1.17` maintenance branch (authored by PX4 maintainers, e.g. `mrpollo@gmail.com`, `dakejahl`, `Claudio-Chies`), not Sees originals.

### Feature groupings

Most of the 57 commits aren't independent — they're installments of five long-running features, built up incrementally over 3+ years:

1. **Safety-pilot RC/Mavlink control-source selector** — `c392d6d1`, `fc334f30`, `988f4bc0`, `60142574`, `72da9ff2`, `bb02f594` (+ telemetry hooks in `1ecc00e7`, `e9b776fe`). Lets ops toggle/monitor RC vs. Mavlink-joystick control source, with FrSky/SYS_STATUS feedback.
2. **Battery SOC / chemistry curve** — `39110b7b`, `b7eed0cd`, `5f316bfa`. Coulomb-counting / voltage-lookup-table SOC estimation tuned to specific packs (25Ah Tattu HV).
3. **Dual-CAN-GPS node-ID ordering / Rover-ID** — `0efcb970`, `e116be69`, `77b5150e`, `b7aa8c4b`, `f918007e`. Ensures stable uORB instance ordering when two CAN GPS units are on the bus.
4. **Custom magnetometer filtering + noise metric** — `b932235e`, `106674e8`, `7ae25eee`. Two-stage low-pass filter + RMS noise calculation on mag data.
5. **FRSky/Horus telemetry customization** — `2337435c`, `e9b776fe`. Custom Smartport DIY streams (dual-GPS, RC/Mav status, flight mode).

(There may be other little ones like geo-fencing. Commits may be missing. Everything else is a standalone fix, tuning value, or CI/tooling change.)

## 3. Porting report: bringing the 57 commits onto `v1.17.0-dev`

Each commit was checked against the `v1.17.0-dev` tip: whether its touched files/functions still exist, whether the same need is already met by an independent upstream change, and whether the surrounding architecture moved enough to require a rewrite rather than a cherry-pick.

### Summary

| Verdict | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Port as-is** | 16 | File/logic essentially unchanged upstream — clean cherry-pick |
| **Port with adaptation** | 26 | Still needed, but surrounding code was rewritten — needs reimplementation |
| **Likely obsolete/superseded** | 15 | Subsystem removed, or upstream independently fixed/added the same thing |
| **Total** | **57** | |

### Porting strategy

- :done: Assign IER score to each item
  - Impact : low/med/high
  - Effort : low/med/high
  - Risk   : low/med/high
- :done: Assign action for each item
  - NO_PORT: ignore our change
  - DEFER_UNTIL_TEST: Test upstream behaviour first. If upstream fix is good, then NO_PORT, otherwise PORT
  - PORT: Implement our change
- :done: Port 'Portable as-is' set first. They are low effort and helps develop familiarity with codebase
- Flight test to resolve all DEFER_UNTIL_TEST to NO_PORT/PORT(with IER score).
  - Define a pass/fail criteria for each such item
- Port most critical feature set for release
  - Feature set: Safety-pilot RC/Mavlink control-source selector
  - Develop Requirements. Have it reviewed. Only then implement
  - Flight test for V&V
- Port next feature set
  - Feature set: Dual CAN-GPS
  - Develop Requirements. Have it reviewed. Only then implement
  - Flight test for V&V
- Port next feature set
  - Feature set: Battery SOC
  - Develop Requirements. Have it reviewed. Only then implement
  - Flight test for V&V
- Port next feature set
  - Feature set: Magnetometer filter
  - Develop Requirements. Have it reviewed. Only then implement
  - Flight test for V&V

**Notes from RH**

- Specify requirements related to each change group. Write them as statements verifiable by pass/fail tests
- Drag estimator (#26): Review/understand the design/approach before implementing fix on v1.17.0. Potential for a simpler fix. Something about derivative kick on step acceleration input. Talk to David/Will.
